"""Device driver compat surface for Mobilerun.

All driver implementations live in ``mobilerun-core-local`` (cloud ones
behind its ``[cloud]`` extra). Framework code imports them from there
directly; this package is kept only so the historical public
``mobilerun.tools.driver`` import path keeps working for external consumers.
